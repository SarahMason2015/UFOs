**<h1>UFOs</h1>**
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p> In 1950 a small-town Farmer in McMinnville, Oregon spotted a UFO, this sighting put that town on the map. Once Dana learned about this it ignited a curiosity of all thing’s UFO. In this project Dana would like to display data gathered from UFO sightings. This data includes states, country, shape, and more! Having so much data at her fingertips, Dana created a JavaScript to sort through the data. Adding multiple filters will allow users to narrow down results. All this data, along with her write-up will be displayed on a webpage for easy access for all UFO enthusiasts.

<h2>Results </h2>
<p> The results of this project were outstanding. Although the data is extremely important a close second is the presentation. When you open the page, your eyes are immediately drawn to a beautiful shot from space of the earth. This creates an aesthetically pleasing look as well as helps to create structure for the rest of the site. As you can see, there is a place for everything. Title, article, data, and filters. 
<p> Scrolling through large amounts of data can be overwhelming and tedious, especially if you’re looking for something specific. Luckily for us, Dana had some great ideas to help filter out data. On the left side you can sort through the data. You can easily track what happened on a particular day, in a particular city, and even shape!

<h2>Summary </h2>
<p> This is an excellent website for basic information. There’s a good bit of data, it’s visually appealing, and filtering information is simple. The downside is that it is almost too simple. Data can’t be easily extracted by users, and the once you move to a different search, the prior data is lost. This can become cumbersome for researchers if they must go back and forth. A few simple recommendations would be to create a way to filter the data multiple times and not lose the data from before. It would be easier to narrow results for CA with a Triangle shape. A final recommendation would be ensuring the appropriate cases are used in the text. For example: CA shows nothing, but ca does. This can be a bit confusing and will potentially cause unwanted errors.
